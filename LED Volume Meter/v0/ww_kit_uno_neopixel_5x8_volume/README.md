# WesWorld Kits - LED Volume Meter - v0 (Coming Soon!) üé∂

Want to see your music‚Äîor even your voice? This kit turns sound into a visual experience. Whether it‚Äôs a song, room ambiance, or your voice, the WesWorld LED Volume Meter lights up to the beat, thanks to a responsive microphone.

## How It Works

The Arduino Uno and NeoPixel Shield create a light display. The microphone sensor captures sound levels, and the Arduino lights up rows of LEDs in real-time. On startup, it shows max volume for 3 seconds to set the range before beginning live response.

1. **Dynamic Mapping**: Sound level lights up from bottom to top.
2. **Color Gradient**: Each row shows a different color, creating a visual sound gradient.
3. **Real-Time Visualization**: LEDs respond to sound intensity or your voice when you speak directly to it.
